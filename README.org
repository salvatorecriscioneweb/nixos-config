#+title: Lunar Systems

* Preface
This documentation is related to my *personal* Nix-based system configuration, designed with three core principles:

- *Minimalism*: Only essential components are included, reducing maintenance overhead and complexity. S*ckless software is something which fascinate me.
- *Wayland-native*: Built around modern display protocols for better security and performance, X11 is stripped out. LabWC + XFCE Panel is used mostly.
- *Security-focused*: Incorporating paranoid-level security practices by default.

The following pages detail how these components work together to create a coherent, maintainable, and secure computing environment using the declarative power of Nix.

All configuration files and documentation are version controlled, and i implement the [[https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/][Erase your darlings]] approach, so yes the entire FS is wiped each reboot.

* NixOS Unstable

My systems are built upon NixOS using the unstable channel to maintain a rolling release approach.

I am a big fan of Opensuse Tumbleweed and Gentoo. These 2 shares this part of being rolling release.

* Core Inputs

** Nixpkgs
   + *Purpose*: Primary package repository providing all system software
   + *Benefits*: Vast collection of reproducible packages
   + *Usage*: Referenced as the primary source for all system packages

** Lanzaboote
   + *Purpose*: Implements secure boot for NixOS
   + *Benefits*: Verifies boot integrity with cryptographic signatures
   + *Usage*: Prevents unauthorized boot code execution and boot-level attacks

** Agenix
   + *Purpose*: Secret management using age encryption
   + *Benefits*: Allows secure storage of sensitive data in the Nix store
   + *Usage*: Manages SSH keys, API tokens, and other sensitive configuration data

* System Enhancement

** Impermanence
   + *Purpose*: Selective file persistence across reboots
   + *Benefits*: Combines immutability with necessary state preservation
   + *Usage*: Defines specific files and directories that persist between system generations

* Additional Resources

** Nixos-hardware
   + *Purpose*: Hardware-specific optimizations
   + *Benefits*: Make others fix my laptop
   + *Usage*: -

** Nix index database
   + *Purpose*: Searchable index of Nix packages and files
   + *Benefits*: Quickly locate packages containing specific files
   + *Usage*: Enhances command-not-found functionality and package discovery

** Stylix
   + *Purpose*: System-wide theme management
   + *Benefits*: Consistent appearance across applications
   + *Usage*: Defines colors, fonts, and other visual elements system-wide
